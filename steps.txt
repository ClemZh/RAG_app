First we create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv ragenv
connection
source ragenv/bin/activate

install the different Lib
pip install django
pip install langchain
pip install sentence-transformers
pip install faiss-cpu
pip install pypdf


We then create the Django project
git init
git remote add origin
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


We will be implementing the functionnality in views.py
We want to implement rag system so we need
-load of the document
-chunking and embedding of the document in a database
-embedding of the question
-initialize the llm

We will be using tinyllama here becuase of hardware limitation. context length is 2048 so we will be chunking the pdf in consequence
For embedding i will be using minilm for lightweight


We then creates the url to call the functions in backend 
We try the app
python3 manage.py runserver
Then we try running this:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask/?question=What%20is%20this%20document%20about?&path_to_pdf=/home/zclem/Documents/Personal_Project/RAG_django_app/RAG_project/aws-overview.pdf
absolute path of the doc


We return to the root of the project to create the Dockerfile
We first create the requirements
pip freeze > requirements.txt
We build the image
docker build -t rag-app .

I have too much unecessary packages in requirements.txt (don't know where they came from despite me using a venv)
I will be doing the installation of the differnt packages directly in the docker script
